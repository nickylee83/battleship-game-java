battleship game java group project

This is a replica of the famous boardgame, battleships game.

Settings

It consists of two players (one is the computer). Each player places five battleships at the desired positions on the board. Each player cannot see the positions of
the oppenent's battleships.

Rules

Thus, one has to guess where the opponent's battleships are located and try to bombard on the board. If your bomb hits the opponent's battleship, it will show on the board
that it hits something. Thus, you know one of the enemy's battleship is there. If it does not hit anything, the bomb will not respond anything.

The player who can hit (and reveal) the locations of all five enemy's battleships win the game.
